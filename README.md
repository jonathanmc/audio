- PreFET distortion
  - <https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2020/07/10/accentize-prefet/>
  - x PreFET is a Machine-Learning based transistor pre-amp emulation which was designed using the same concept as PreTube. The included artificial neural network has learnt to precisely imitate the transistor pre-amp stage of a 70s tabletop cassette recorder. Depending on the Drive-Setting PreFET can colour your sounds from subtle analogue saturation to heavy overdrive.
  - Tumult
  - https://github.com/consint/Tumult
  - Tumult makes noise. Tumult texturizes, accentuates and adds warmth and age. Tumult comes with 50 hand-picked noises. You can play them raw, let them follow your sounds, or duck them away. Tumult comes with an 5-band EQ that lets you shape the noises to your liking. Tumult is a free and open source 64bit VST3 effect plugin for Linux and Windows.


##### chorus

- Acon
  - https://acondigital.com- 
  - chorus and an EQ
  - Acon Digital Multiply is a free and versatile chorus effect with a unique twist. Each simulated voice is processed with a phase randomizing filter so that unpleasant comb filter effects are avoided. The effect can be used to simulate the effect of several performers playing the same tones simultaneously, to widen the spatial image or to create special effects for sound design. Multiply can simulate up to 6 additional voices and both the pitch and the loudness of the voices can be modulated. There is also an integrated equalizer consisting of low cut, low shelf, high shelf and high cut filters that can be applied to the effect signal. An integrated pre-delay section makes it possible to create modulated and diffuse echo effects.

- GCHQ
  - GCHQ is a convolution reverb which uses impulse response data from various famous landmarks found on the OpenAir project (<http://www.openairlib.net/>). Limitations. GCHQ currently does not report the correct latency when the reverb program is changed during playback. You will need to reload GCHQ or restart the audio engine for correct latency compensation everytime the reverb program is changed. The user interface looks like a design accident from the 90s... There are several potential optimizations in the impulse response code that haven't been implemented yet. Currently, the impulse responses are mono only

## 2. Graphics

- <https://github.com/huginn/huginn>
- KDenlive for video editing
- IrfanView @ http://www.irfanview.com/.  Free graphics viewer.  It also does basic graphics editing and the plugins are quite useful, too.  Install SmartCurves (a plugin) if you want to edit levels properly.
- GIMP @ http://www.gimp.org/.  Open source bitmap graphics editor. Basically an open source version of Adobe's Photoshop or Corel Draw.
- Photivo @ http://www.photivo.org.  Open source digital photo editor. Crazy number of options. Crashes sometimes.
- Picasa. Basic photo editor. Integrates tightly to Google. Defunct now.

### RawTherapee stuff

- Raw Therapee @ http://www.rawtherapee.com.  Open source digital photo editor. Fewer options than Photivo, but more stable.
